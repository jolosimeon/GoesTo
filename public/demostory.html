                            <p>My grandfather is a loving and very disciplined person.I wanted to learn more of his past and our family traditions and so I asked him. As he answered, "Son we used to play sungka as part of our past time". I did not even know what sungka was before but it was actually a game played by most filipinos before. The way of courting was also very different back then. He said that they would sing at night in front the girl's house. This really touched me since I believe that this is a better way of showing love rather than go and meet someone at a random party. He also mentioned that his family was under Martial Law where they had to follow rules such as curfew. He also told that he joined the EDSA Revolution to go against the government. Another tradition he wanted to preserve was respecting the elders by doing "Mano Po". I learned a lot from him and hoped that he was still with me. </p>

                            <p>I hope that we are able to preserve our past traditions like some of these. From my grandpa, I hope that we are able to spread these traditions and revive them in our culture today since most of them are not seen anymore because we have forgot the importance and meaning of these traditions.</p>
